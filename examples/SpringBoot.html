  <p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".</p>
<p>We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Create stand-alone Spring applications</p>
<p>Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)</p>
<p>Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration</p>
<p>Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible</p>
<p>Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration</p>
<p>Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration</p>
